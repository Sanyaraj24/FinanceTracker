onAuthStateChanged returns an unsubscribe function that can be used to remove the listener.

In the useEffect hook, we store this function in the unsubscribe variable.

This cleanup is important because:

It removes the listener when the component unmounts

Prevents memory leaks

Stops unnecessary updates to an unmounted component
